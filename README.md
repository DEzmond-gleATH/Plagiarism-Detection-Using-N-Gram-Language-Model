# Plagiarism-Detection-Using-N-Gram-Language-Model

Hey there!

Welcome to my inaugural GitHub code repository. In this code, I've crafted a plagiarism detecting tool.

Here's how it works:

You input the subject of your file, which can be a document in various formats like DOC, PDF, or TXT.
Once you submit the file, the magic begins. The code fetches the top 10 links related to your topic and starts comparing your document with each webpage using an n-gram language model.
The outcome is elegantly displayed in the form of a heatmap. On the left side, you'll see your content, and on the right side, the heatmap. The heatmap showcases colors that correspond to each word in your document. The darker the shade, the higher the likelihood of potential plagiarism.

The results page unfolds in two parts:

First, the summary presents the document most closely related to a specific webpage based on our language model.
Following that, you'll find the top 10 Google search results along with their respective heatmaps.
I embarked on this journey to not only refine my understanding of Natural Language Processing but also to cultivate a deeper interest in the exciting domain of AI.

A couple of upgrades that could be possible:
1.Enhancing the code to provide even more accurate probabilities.
2.Giving the webpage's UI a facelift for a more user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore and let me know your thoughts. Happy learning and coding ahead! ðŸš€
